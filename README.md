# Movies-Correlation-Project
This project analyzes a dataset of movies to explore relationships between numeric features like budget, gross revenue, runtime, ratings, votes, and release year. Using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, it computes a correlation matrix, highlights strong correlations, and visualizes patterns with heatmaps and regression plots.
